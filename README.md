# Spotify-Interface-Clone
A simple clone of Spotify Interface HTML & CSS Only

For an evident reason, i don't have same icons/Fonts that Spotify uses so i did it with FontAwesome which has pretty similar icons. Moreover, it's not a pixel perfect copy, i made some adjustement which are probably not the best but the result is good

Don't pay attention to some classes which are not used, i forgot to delete them.
And i didn't succeed to use FontAwesome in placeholder with Unicode for a strange reason that i still don't know so i used a position relative.

Feel Free to help you with it !
